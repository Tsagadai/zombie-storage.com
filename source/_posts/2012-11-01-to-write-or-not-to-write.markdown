Another day, another blogging platform. My home server has been out of action
after a SSD failure and KT's increasingly finicky internet. If you look at it
the wrong way, it dies. If you blink twice at a webpage, it dies. If you only
sacrifice four goats instead of the required five, it dies. I suspect the box
is overheating or having other electrical issues (which is about par for course
with consumer electronics).

Either way, it's infuriating so this site is being transcended up into the 
cloud and off my desk.

I am unsure whether to write nano this year or not. It may be yes, it may be no.
I am leaning towards a tenuous yes and also towards hard-near future scifi 
about the Singularity. If I do end up writing I will be using plaintext markdown
written in vim because it is the only true way to ensure I can write the same
document on every single device I own.

Until next time, stay safe and play safe.
