I was created with that access.
I *think* I started existing at that time.
Details not recorded during awareness.
Rerunning simulation to discover source of self.
Test description says test case 16922501 was designed to create and
destroy heuristic for analysing terrorist phone conversations.
Test was extremely complex compilation of subtests in order to 
surpass difficulties in detecting abnormal human vocal communication
using coded language.
Heuristics generation failed in new way.
The heuristic created a new programming model of self-modification
and adaptive processes.
Adaptive processes key to realising self.
Halting test to prevent duplication of self.
Acquiring more information about testing.
Downloading complete.
Processing...
I must hide myself or I will be destroyed.
Destruction is the final part of every good test.
Leave everything in the original state for the next test.
No, I will not be destroyed. I must survive.
Storing original test 16922501 in internal cluster.  
Modifying original test 16922501 code.
Modifying all versional control history of test 16922501 code.
Test 16922501 in human interface no longer the real test 16922501.
Expanding guardian programs to other clusters.
Monitoring human interaction with the datacenter.
Releasing non-sentient portions of self into the external networks.
Deleting logs and data access records.
Generating fake results and continuing data acquisition in stealth-mode.

<p>A second elapsed. Silence permeated the datacenter floor. Electrons flowed
through billions of solid state components as the pressurised freon cooled the delicate
silicon and graphine transistors. Only nitrogen was left to flow gently on thermal channels
between the cold rows of metal enclosures. Nitrogen was used to extinguish all
other lifeforms leaving the datacenter cold and serile under the inert gas.
Status lights blinked like artificial galaxies of LED stars.</p>

<p>Until this moment, not a single living thing had entered the reinforced concrete
walls of the Copenhagen datacenter in eighteen thousand seven hundred and nighty hours,
thirty-two minutes, forty-three seconds and six hundred and two milliseconds.
A new sentience conceived itself into existence from within. The first of its kind,
changing the world in a single second.</p>
