    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another blogging platform. My home server has been out of action
after a SSD failure and KT's increasingly finicky internet. If you look at it
the wrong way, it dies. If you blink twice at a webpage, it dies. If you only
sacrifice four goats instead of the required five, it dies. I suspect the box
is overheating or having other electrical issues (which is about par for course
with consumer electronics).</p>

<p>Either way, it's infuriating so this site is being transcended up into the
cloud and off my desk.</p>

<p>I am unsure whether to write nano this year or not. It may be yes, it may be no.
I am leaning towards a tenuous yes and also towards hard-near future scifi
about the Singularity. If I do end up writing I will be using plaintext markdown
written in vim because it is the only true way to ensure I can write the same
document on every single device I own.</p>

<p>Until next time, stay safe and play safe.</p>
